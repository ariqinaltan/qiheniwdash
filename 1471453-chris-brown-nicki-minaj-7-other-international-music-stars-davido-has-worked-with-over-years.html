The Sample</h2><p class=align-left>Davido <a href=#>released his first official single</a> for the year, Stand Strong, some weeks ago to the delight of his fans and supporters.</p><p class=align-left>Known for putting an extra spice in his tracks, the hitmaker went through the trouble of collaborating with Kanye West’s Sunday Service choir, The Sample.</p><p class=align-left>As expected, the track became an instant hit track proving his flexibility to work with artistes from any background once again.</p><h2>2. Chris Brown</h2><p class=align-left>The US music star has remained accessible to the afrobeats cause from inception and it comes as no surprise that he has tracks with frontrunners of the genre.</p><p class=align-left>Davido and Brown have worked on a couple of successful music collaborations together, with their relationship moving from professional to 'brotherly'.</p><p class=align-left>Blow My Mind, Shopping Spree and Lower Body are some of their tracks together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/199e19175f0389ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The tragedy and incredible life of Daniel Johnston</span></p></a><h2>3. Nicki Minaj</h2><p class=align-left>The excitement was through the roof when Davido made the announcement that he has a song with international rap star, Nicki Minaj.</p><p class=align-left>Davido and Nicki worked on Holy Grail, a song off his A Better Time album, and the track was an instant hit.</p><p class=align-left>Although he promised to shoot a video, it appears that was a difficult task to achieve for his team.</p><h2>4. Meek Mill</h2><p class=align-left>This was yet another music collaboration between the 30BG musician and international rap star, Meeks Mills.</p><p class=align-left>The track titled, Fans Mi, became an instant hit with many praising the seamless blend of sounds between the two.</p><p class=align-left>Davido also made sure to release an official music video to the delight of fans.</p><p></p><h2>5. Summer Walker</h2><p class=align-left>In the same album that had a collaboration with Chris Brown, Davido pulled another surprise with a track featuring Summer Walker.</p><p class=align-left>Fans had been left with speculations about what to expect after the tracklist for A Good Time was released, but were they pleasantly surprised?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7c1933b241bea71d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mr Eazi - Let Me Live My Life was a show stopper at Coachella</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The track became an instant favourite for many and the synergy between Davido and Walker in the official video increased streaming numbers.</p><p></p><h2>6. Popcaan</h2><p class=align-left>Davido's A Good Time album, also saw him making music with Popcaan for hit track, Risky.</p><p class=align-left>This was the second time the music stars worked together as Davido had previously worked on a song with Pocaan titled Dun Rich.</p><p class=align-left>Like his previous international collaborations, he completed the experience for music lovers by releasing an official video.</p><p></p><h2>7. Tinashe</h2><p class=align-left>For his least favourite project, Son of Mercy, Davido worked with international songstress Tinashe on a track titled How Long.</p><p class=align-left>To this day, the 30BG musician doesn't have a lot of positive words for the entire project as it wasn't exactly his best.</p><p class=align-left>However, the track with Tinashe was an indication of his potential to blend perfectly with the western sound.</p><p></p><h2>8. Wale</h2><p class=align-left>Just like Chris Brown, Nigerian-American rapper, Wale, was among the first crop of international stars who opened their arms to the afrobeats star.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d90a0f399e9dbd16.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daddy Yankee net worth and amazing career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2017, Wale collaborated with Davido and indigenous rap musician, Olamide, on a track titled Fine Girl.</p><p class=align-left>An official video featuring all three music stars was also released.</p><p></p><h2>9. Dababy</h2><p class=align-left>Rap star Dababy was recently in Nigeria and it was only for one reason—to <a href=#>work with Davido.</a></p><p class=align-left>The music stars who have had a cordial relationship were in the <a href=#>Lagos</a> Island area to film the official music video for Davido's next single.</p><h2>Gospel star Kirk Franklin jams Davido's song</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng </strong>reported that gospel star Kirk Franklin seems to have caught the Stand Strong bug as he <a href=#>recently jammed the track.</a></p><p class=align-left>An excited Davido shared a video of Franklin singing the song word for word as he thanked him for being a part of the movement.</p><p class=align-left>Fans and colleagues flooded the comment section to hail Franklin for showing support for the Nigerian superstar.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZqbGdmgXZ%2FjJyfq6GjYq%2Bzu9anZKehk6C2brnIp5ijZWdivLW0xKtkoqakmr%2BvrdOipqeZnGK6tr%2FInGSsrJGnwG6wwK%2Bgnaddna60edaoqaSdlGLEqsDHZqavnaJixqat0axm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-draft-net-worth-262483.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Draft Net Worth 2024">&larr;
