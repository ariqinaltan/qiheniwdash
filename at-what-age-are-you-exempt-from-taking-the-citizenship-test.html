This is commonly referred to as the "65/20 exception."<h2>How can I become a U.S. citizen at 65?</h2>The Immigration and Nationality Act provides special consideration for applicants who, at the time of filing their Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, are aged 65 years old or older, and who have been living in the United States as a lawful permanent resident for at least 20 years.<h2>How many questions are on the 65 year old citizenship test?</h2>The civics test is an oral test and covers important topics about American government and history.

They must either have 40 U.S. work credits (about 10 years' worth) or come from a country that has a totalization agreement with the U.S.<h2>Can citizenship interview be waived?</h2>The updated policy explicitly gives USCIS officers discretion to waive interviews of the family members of U.S. citizens and green card holders who have conditional permanent resident status and submitted Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residency.<h2>How many times can I fail the US citizenship test?</h2>According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, there is no limit to the number of times you can retake the naturalization test. However, if you only failed a portion of the test, you may not need to retake the entire thing. You have two tries to pass the English and civics portion of the test.<h2>Can you take the citizenship test if you are illiterate?</h2>Permanent residents age 50 or older with at least 20 years of permanent residence can get U.S. citizenship without showing the ability to read, write and speak English.
