Axolotls are much more difficult to treat than fish since a lot of chemicals used in medicine are toxic to them. Some possibly compatible fish are danios, guppies, mosquitofish, rosy red minnows, and white cloud minnows.</span></span> <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on reddit.com</a><h2>Can you put an axolotl with a betta?</h2>No, you can't successfully keep an axolotl and a betta together in the same aquarium. Axolotls absolutely prefer much cooler water than a better would be comfortable with. Axolotls are also impressive predators and will eat the betta eventually.
