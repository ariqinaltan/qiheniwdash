The jamboree is also not a real event. The entire article was false, one of many written by Blair under the alias “Flagg Eagleton”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair said that at one point he feared that it would be too obvious the article was fake. “As soon as I wrote the headline, I said to myself that it might be a little bit much,” Blair said. “But it wasn’t.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Abbott still genuinely responded to the fake article from his personal Twitter account. “Go Woke. Go Broke,” Abbott wrote about the false story.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Garth called his conservative fans assholes. Good job, Texas,” Abbott added, referring to the booing.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Abbott quickly deleted the tweet. But several Twitter users took screenshots of the gaffe and mocked Abbott.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Way to go governor Abbott!” <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a> one Twitter user. Another user <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">called</a> Abbott a “sucker” for being fooled by the article.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Abbott’s office could not be reached by the Guardian for comment.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Republicans have denounced Brooks after he <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">announced</a> that his Nashville bar would serve Bud Light beer and encouraged his customers to be tolerant.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Far-right and anti-trans figures have <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">criticized</a> the beer brand for working with the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney</a> for a promotion during the annual March Madness national college basketball tournament.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair said Abbott is not the first public official to share false articles written by himself or other satirical writers.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, has also reposted a Dunning-Kruger-Times article.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Miller responded to a false article about Kyle Rittenhouse taking out a lien against the actor Whoopi Goldberg’s house. “She refuses to pay. He’s within his rights. He seems to be very good at that,” Miller wrote on Facebook, according to a screenshot shared by Blair.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair has run America’s Last Line of Defense (Allod), which operates the Dunning-Kruger-Times and other satirical websites, since 2016, when Donald Trump was elected US president.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair, who self-identifies as a “professional liberal troll”, said the goal of the website was to expose the “gullibility of rightwing extremists”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Before this “operation”, Blair received attention for hijacking a conservative Facebook page and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">posting pictures of goats</a> as the online liberal personality “Busta Troll”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Fake articles created by Blair and other Allod affiliates usually cover topics associated with conservatives’ culture war, including Garth Brooks and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the M&M candy controversy</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“They get so riled up over nothing,” Blair said of the conservatives who reshare his article. “Right now, they’re at war with Garth Brooks. He doesn’t care.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair added that much of the focus on cultural issues among conservatives “comes from the top in the conservative world”, from figures like Tucker Carlson.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Anything to take away from what’s happening to Trump,” Blair said. “Anything to take away from what the Republican party is doing in general. Anything to take away from the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">corruption in the supreme court</a>.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair says he has received criticism from people who say that he is propagating misinformation, but contends that the site openly advertises as being false.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The Dunning-Kruger-Times.com website reads: “Dunning-Kruger-Times.com is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery, or as Snopes called it before they lost their war on satire: Junk News.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“At the end of the day, somebody is telling them that this is fake,” Blair said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair said it was “disappointing” to see public officials share articles that are clearly fake. “I shake my head. To see it shared by people who matter, I shake my head and I chuckle,” Blair said. “It’s really disappointing to see so many people over the years who have just been dumb enough. Greg Abbott, especially.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK2jYrumw9JoaWlqY2S3triOam5on6KatG6twZumraxdqL2wu8Vmqq2noq56qK3RrZ9mmqKkvKy%2FjJqsraCfp3qlwcyb</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ben-wallace-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Wallace Net Worth 2024">&larr;
