They disguised themselves as slaves and followed the instructions of Edmond, who claimed to be the manager of the store.</p><p>Edmond explained that the store was a place where the Derelicts, the people who had no mana, could receive a concentrated mana pill and make a contract with a spirit. He said that this was a way to help them improve their lives and escape from poverty and discrimination.</p><p>However, Daven and his companions soon realized that this was a lie, and that the store was actually a trap. The mana pill was a drug that made the Derelicts addicted and obedient, and the contract was a forced pact that bound them to the conspiracy. The Derelicts were then taken to a secret facility, where they were used as human experiments and mana stone producers.</p><p>Daven, who had taken the mana pill as well, felt a surge of pain and anger in his body. He realized that this was the effect of the Daven’s Evil Spirit, which was a manifestation of his resentment and hatred from his past life. The Daven’s Evil Spirit tried to take over his mind and make him kill everyone around him.</p><p>Meanwhile, a mysterious man appeared at the entrance of the store. He had a sinister smile and a murderous aura. He said that he had been waiting for Daven for a long time, and that he knew his true identity. He also said that he had a connection to his past life, and that he was the one who betrayed him and killed him.</p><p>Who is this man, and what is his motive? How will Daven deal with the Daven’s Evil Spirit and the Derelict conspiracy? What secrets will be revealed about his past life and his reincarnation?
