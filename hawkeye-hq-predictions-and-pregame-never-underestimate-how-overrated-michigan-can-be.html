Jaster (@Hawkologist) <a href=#>August 25, 2017</a></figure><p>Still true. And the Wolverines are still picked to win the East regularly. But as much as “votes” count in college football, division championships aren’t awarded to teams just because “it’s time,” like Karl Malone and the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="NBA MVP (opens in a new tab)" href=#>NBA MVP</a></strong> in 1997. Thankfully, more and more is decided on the field.</p><p>Not saying that Iowa deserves to be in the big three. Not at all (although Wisconsin probably has a claim in the #B1GFCG era). It’s just that Michigan is given every advantage every year, so it’s hard to filter out what’s hype.</p><p>Oddly enough, never was this more apparent than when I loaded up the EA Sports NCAA Football 2004 for this week’s “totally irrelevant prediction.”</p><p>More on that computerized prophecy below — and what a wild one it is — but it was very relevant to this conversation.</p><p>In it, Iowa was unranked and Michigan was No. 10. That game precedes the 2003 season, and Iowa finished 2002 ranked No. 8 after an Orange Bowl loss to USC. Michigan finished No. 9 and won the Outback Bowl. But Iowa beat Michigan in The Big House 34-9 that year. Yet the Hawkeyes fell off the poll and Michigan was ranked 10th to start? It’s true.</p><p>Despite that, Iowa climbed all the way back to No. 8 by the end of 2003 with a 10-3 record and a 37-17 win over Florida in the Outback Bowl while Michigan also finished 10-3, losing to USC in the Rose Bowl, and ended up at No. 6. Once again, Iowa won the head-to-head matchup 30-27, this time at Kinnick.</p><p>So how did the AP Top 25 preseason poll look in 2004? Iowa was No. 19 and Michigan was No. 8. Iowa finished that season 10-2 and in the No. 8 spot for a third year in a row, and Michigan ended up 9-3 and at No. 14. The Wolverines did win the head-to-head at home 30-17 that year.</p><p>And by the next preseason AP poll, Iowa had dropped to No. 11 and Michigan was ranked 4th. Sorry, Hawkeyes, you’re just not a perennial preseason Top 10 team even when you are one on the field.</p><p>This is not to disrespect Michigan. It’s just that even during Iowa’s best run of the Kirk Ferentz era, the Wolverines started at the 20-yard line of the national conversation while Iowa’s best field position was, at best, the 50. The Hawkeyes had to prove it every year and did. Michigan has the hype handed to them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jim Harbaugh sure is popular.

The biggest shock comes two plays and seven seconds later — a 29-yard pick six that gives the Hawkeyes their first lead of the game.
