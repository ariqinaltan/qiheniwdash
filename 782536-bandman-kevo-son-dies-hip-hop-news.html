The artist and entrepreneur took to his Instagram story where he stated that his son Kevian had passed away at the age of 15. Furthermore, he shared a new story that revealed his son was the victim of gun violence. The alleged incident went down in Michigan. Overall, it is an incredibly sad story, and one that has become all too common these days. Gun violence is a massive problem in the United States, and nothing has seemingly been done to try and solve it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While taking to Twitter, Kevo wrote "RIP Kevian" with two angel emojis. Following this announcement, Kevo received a ton of support from fans. However, some were not happy with his reactions on Instagram. For instance, one person on Twitter noted that Kevo had posted a video of him flexing, shortly after the announcement of his son's passing. This allegedly flex video was promptly deleted from his page.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bandman-kevo-speaks>Bandman Kevo Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kevo recently stated that he was trying to get a hold of Kevian's mother, but he hasn't been able to. Needless to say, this is a very sad situation. It comes amidst Kevo's opening of a new school. The Finesse God Scam School was a venture to help people recognize common scams. It is most definitely a unique idea, and it is one that is supposedly going to make him $10 million. However, we imagine all of his focus will be on his family during this time.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Our thoughts and prayers go out to Bandman Kevo during this incredibly difficult time. We cannot imagine the pain of losing a child at such a young age. Hopefully, he will be able to find peace during this time, while the perpetrators are brought to justice.
