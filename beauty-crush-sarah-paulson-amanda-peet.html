The actresses and best friends, who lovingly call each other the nickname "Bird," first met on the set of the '90s WB show, Jack & Jill, and instantly bonded over, among other things, their shared love of Abercrombie & Fitch cargo pants. Over the last 20 years, they've stayed by each other's sides through every fashion fad and impulsive haircut, so for InStyle's August issue, we caught up with the longtime pals to talk about their beauty evolution, celebrity doppelgängers, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for our full chat below.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>You've been best friends since you met on the set of <i>Jack & Jill </i>in the '90s. What do you remember most about each other's looks back then?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SARAH PAULSON: </b>Amanda loved the parachute pants from Abercrombie & Fitch. We thought they made our asses look particularly good, but our asses were actually just good back then. [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AMANDA PEET: </b>You wore a lot of Juicy Couture sweatpants too. And didn't you wear a shrug to the première of <i>The Whole Nine Yards </i>[below]?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Paul Skipper/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>I wore shrugs on our TV program, not in real life, my friend. To that première I wore a sparkly dress from [the L.A. store] Polkadots & Moonbeams. I do remember my hair, though — someone took a small-barrel curling iron around my whole head. I was so obsessed with looking like Julia Roberts that my mouth was hanging open doing Julia Roberts smiles the whole time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>So how have your looks evolved since those days?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>Since the parachute pants? A lot, I hope!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>Here's the truth: I didn't know how to do almost anything from a fashion or beauty standpoint. Amanda was always more aware of what was cool. Bird, remember when you cut your hair short and dyed it blond?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>Yes, and it was not good. [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>Well, I quickly copied you. And that continues to happen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What does your beauty regimen look like now in quarantine?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>We're not doing much of anything because, you know, we're not going anywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>But we talk many times a day, and occasionally Amanda will FaceTime me and I'll have a weird mask on or something that looks like baby diarrhea on my face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>It's comforting to think it's going to matter at some point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>I just don't want to fall apart too much for when — God willing — we're all back in a world where we can work again.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Crotty/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Do you miss doing the red-carpet thing yet?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>The red carpet can still be intimidating, but it's just not as important to us as it used to be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>Yeah, I like the fun of playing dress-up, but then there's another component that really does feel like work. Everything is so dissected on social media now. We try to put that to the side and let it be a celebration. I can tell you right now, though, my feet are not missing those heels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What has been your most memorable red-carpet moment?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>About a year ago I got out of the car in full hair and makeup, and as I took my fancy red-carpet stance, people yelled, "Lake Bell! Lake, over here!" Part of me was really excited because she's so hot. But then I was like, "Wow, I feel bad for her that this is happening to me." [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>And people are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>saying I look like Adele now</a>. She's beautiful, but I just don't really see it. I'll take it, though, you know?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>Same! Bird, my favorite look of yours was the sparkly Carolina Herrera dress with the puffed sleeves at the 2017 Emmys [above].</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>I love the backless Rochas look you wore to the Met Ball in 2006 [below].

Tracey was working for Sally Hershberger when we met, and now I can't even get in!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>I always make the appointment, and then Amanda will say, "I'm gonna come too." But she just slaps on some highlights, whereas I'm in there for five hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>I do feel like we need to set the record straight on one thing, though: Sarah Paulson has not had any work done on her face at any point in time, OK, everybody? Can we put that in print? Those are her lips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>Honestly, I have no judgment about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>someone having work done</a>, but for me, it's important to try to accept the inevitable reality of my face. I'd like to say that I'm never going to do it, but I also say, "Let's see how I feel when things have radically headed south."

One time I was in L.A. shooting, and Bird drove all the way to the set just to bring me some because my lips were falling off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>I'm a good friend! Lately, I've been loving the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hourglass Ambient Lighting palette</a>. It's a very soft powder that gives this great iridescent light.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>See, why don't I know about this?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>Well, you don't wear a lot of powder — you're a mascara-and-lip girl.

There is no bravery involved. But some of my more badass moments happened when I was younger, like when I took a box of jet-black L'Oréal hair dye and covered my head with it. I was a sad faux-punk teenager.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>I want to see that picture. I put the Jolen lip bleach — that I should have been using on my mustache — on my hair. And then it turned green.

I'd want you to revisit that, Bird.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>I really loved your hair at that Bottega Veneta event that we went to in 2016 [below].

[laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_97-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>Yes, there was a moment when Amanda thought eating a lot of Tofutti Cuties — which are essentially ice-cream sandwiches — was healthy because they're tofu. Then one day she couldn't zip up her Katayone Adeli pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_99-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>AP: </b>It's a testament to how close we are that you were able to say, "You need to do just one a day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>SP: </b>I wish I'd had a better sense of humor about everything.
