Overall, he is someone who is considered to be a huge troll that is hard to take seriously. However, there are some instances where he actually has some good takes. He can be serious when he needs to be, especially on topics involving race. In fact, many have praised Bayless in the past for his nuance when discussing race, particularly in the NFL. Needless to say, he isn't a reactionary like the uncle you hate to see at Christmas.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Race in the NFL has been a huge topic as of late due to the lack of job offers for Eric Bieniemy. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Bieniemy is the offensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs</a>, and despite all of their success, no one will hire him as a head coach. Consequently, he is thinking of a lateral move to the Washington Commanders where he can be an OC without the shadow of Andy Reid standing over his shoulder. Overall, it is a pretty upsetting situation as it showcases how black coaches struggle to be taken seriously.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-skip-bayless-speaks>Skip Bayless Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For Bayless, this all boils down to the fact that white owners are simply too uncomfortable with having to talk to black coaches on a daily basis. He believes the owners are stuck in their ways. However, he doesn't know how this could eventually change for the better. "These older white owners just aren’t that comfortable with a Black head coach because they need to interact, they need to go to dinner with the wives or the [significant others] or whatever," said. "[White owners are] just not that comfortable. When they do have an interview, it’s gonna be a quicker click with a young white hot candidate."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bayless ultimately ended his take by stating that the NFL can't mandate teams to hire black coaches. Although, Bayless believes owners like the Rooneys have done the right thing over the years. Hopefully, the NFL will change for the better in this regard. There are plenty of amazing black coaches who have yet to be given opportunities. As the world gets more progressive, perhaps the NFL will too.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
