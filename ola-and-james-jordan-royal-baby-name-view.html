Lilibet was the <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen</a>'s childhood nickname and Diana is after Prince Harry's late mother.</p><p id=elP4wS2KlKsi data-wc=26>Following reports in the press over whether the royal couple sought the monarch's permission to use the name, we asked Ola and James for their views.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1145b0c70c62-archie-harrison-z.jpg><p id=e4D0H0XdJ8qg data-wc=7><strong>Harry and Meghan with their son Archie</strong></p><p id=eTnqKySV3nvT data-wc=22>James says: "My opinion on that is you should be able to call your child whatever you want to call your child.</p><p id=ei1zrfbq5VsK data-wc=36>"I think it's more ridiculous when people call their children these stupid names like peanut butter, pea for short! I find that more annoying. <strong>I think it's actually a level of respect that they're honouring her."</strong></p><p id=eD8P95XWMSym data-wc=31>Ola tells us: "I suppose they didn't have to ask anyone, did they? <strong>Ella's second name is Amelia which was my great grandmother's name. I didn't have to ask anyone's permission.</strong></p><p id=eCz_AgrnYdI9 data-wc=38>"But on the other hand, it's created a lot of hoo-ha, which I find strange because they didn't want any press, they want to be quite private. I loved Prince Harry. I always wanted him to do Strictly!"</p><p id=eFNsoibx5-dX data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>12 summer kids clothing bargains we found on eBay: from girls floral dresses to boys T-shirts</a></strong></p><h2>Deciding on Ella's name</h2><p id=eiqrc4Nt7xuk data-wc=14>Ella is a beautiful name, so how did the couple come up with it?</p><p id=ep6myMFnC3ej data-wc=32>James reveals: "Originally if we had a girl we were more down the lines of Sophia or Hannah. Then Ola said she really liked Bella so we compromised and called her Ella.</p><p id=eKekNNNv7N83 data-wc=26>"Then you've got Ola and Ella. <strong>Sometimes I call Ella and Ola and Ola Ella and I get all confused. My brain can't cope with it!"</strong></p><h2>Ola's real name!</h2><p id=efc2aMO45oHlj data-wc=37>This has come as a shock to us at <strong>HELLO!</strong> as Ola is actually a nickname, not the star's real first name. "<strong>My real name is Alexandra, but Ola is short for Alexandra in Poland," Ola explains.</strong></p><p id=eaH_ZLHllEsRv data-wc=22>James adds: "It's like Robert and Bob. But I never ever call her Alexandra, nor do her mum or dad or anyone."</p><p id=eXhXfv48bfafg data-wc=29>And even more interesting is that on Ola's first Strictly show, she was meant to be called Alexandra but there was a change of plan at the last minute.</p><p id=ew8mUkAw-vynA data-wc=27>"She was going to come down and hear, 'Please welcome to the dancefloor DJ Spoony and Alexandra Jordan' and for whatever reason they put 'Ola'," James reveals.</p><p id=eP4TmRU0DRZXy data-wc=29>Ola says: "I was like, 'Oh no!' <strong>At the time I was devastated but I got used to it. I'm glad now though as it sticks a bit more."</strong></p><p id=ellnyofZmQ_mt data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>How baby Lilibet's birth weight compares to other royal newborns</a></strong></p><h2>Ella goes swimming</h2><p id=eZSngLyIteHM7 data-wc=29>Sweet Ella loved her first proper dip in the family swimming pool this week as the trio enjoyed the hot weather. So how did she take to the water?</p><p id=ehjnLfDNqmfTf data-wc=33>"She was unsure in the beginning," James tells us. "We took her in when she was a few months old so she wouldn't remember. It's the first time she's known what's going on."</p><p id=eBczLlDJL4OZ1 data-wc=45>Ola adds: <strong>"She really got into it though and she loved it in the end. When we took her out she wanted to stay in! </strong>We had beautiful weather but daddy got sunburnt. Ella had factor 50 all over with her little factor 50 swimsuit."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/80071f6f4774-ella-swim-z.jpg><p id=eEvlQJijvUfgL data-wc=8><strong>Ella had a fun time swimming at home</strong></p><p id=eNLqq0ADfXLOM data-wc=13>In the video we see Ella take her hat off, looking pretty unimpressed.</p><p id=e7VcE1tlXUJPQ data-wc=56><strong>"She does not like the hat," </strong>says mum. "I keep forcing the hat on her all the time when we go out in the sun but she doesn't like it at all. She knows what she wants, you know. She's a bit stubborn like that I'd say. How do you convince children to wear a hat?!"</p><p id=e8v4qukNR4_ES data-wc=16>The parents are planning on hiring a swimming teacher to get Ella confident in the water.</p><p id=emo9dxg4KzXeo data-wc=25>"I wanted to dip her under the water yesterday but mummy wouldn't let me," James tells us. "Ola's worried that we're going to scare her."</p><p id=eZ638NiOOC7KU data-wc=20>"I don't know what's best but maybe I'll get a teacher to come for a couple of lessons," replied Ola.</p><h2>Staying safe by the pool</h2><p id=ej4-NSGW2Rtv4 data-wc=24>Like all parents, Ola and James keep a close eye on Ella near the water, and Ola tells us that she's a little worried.</p><p id=eU5D8F4W8qOve data-wc=24><strong>"I'm really nervous when the pool is open so I like it closed. We've got a special cover that's great for kids," she says</strong>.</p><p id=e6X-pUmqsrMCn data-wc=56>James adds: "And I'm not nervous at all because you have to go into the basement to go out to the pool. Ella's not going to be outside when the pool cover's open, because we only ever open it when we're out there using it. If she falls in the pool, I'm going to be there.</p><p id=ejc7mgKt-Wea- data-wc=32>"But you're a swimmer and I'm not so we look at that differently," explains Ola. "We don't have a deep end. I wanted a pool where I can touch the floor everywhere."</p><p id=erH_TQFySB_IH data-wc=17>And it seems some of James' social media followers are vocal with their views on the subject.</p><p id=ecz4UcPXLUkbZ data-wc=49>James reveals: "It's funny actually on Instagram, the number of people saying, 'You need to get a fence put around your pool'. But when you have a safety cover you don't have to. <strong>You could drive a car on that safety cover. I walk across it all the time."</strong></p><h2>Shopping with Ella</h2><p id=eQ3P8bX9n6m91 data-wc=25>There was another trip to the shops this week for the Jordans, however, all did not go to plan. <strong>"We tried to shop!" says James.</strong></p><p id=eBBhSE0Z0jDOW data-wc=24>Ola explains: "It's hard because Ella wants to get out of the pram, then it's not shopping is it?" We totally get it, Ola!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/416fb1f34d08-ola-jordan-z.jpg><p id=eAiQA7OJUIrzY data-wc=11><strong>Ola prefers some mummy me-time when it comes to the shops!</strong></p><p id=e-57ngFepE3qE data-wc=37>James says: "Then mummy says to me, 'That's the last time I come with both of you'. It's like I'm a child as well! 'You two can stay at home next time, I'm coming on my own."</p><h2>Mum and dad's night out!</h2><p id=e0icao0a-lCvE data-wc=17>We're so happy for Ola and James, who are having their first child-free night out this Friday.</p><p id=eil5YcUEgg64Q data-wc=20>Ola beams: "We're going to see how that's going to go down because I'll put Ella to bed by 7pm.</p><p id=eY51-jiYGPq_X data-wc=35>"We're going out for dinner with some friends and my sister is going to come and babysit. <strong>Hopefully, she won't wake up. If my sister has to go into her room, then it's game over."</strong></p><p id=e0WYWOnAMMV7r data-wc=10>We're crossing all our fingers and toes for you both.</p><p id=eKpXev88JqZ46 data-wc=23><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnxzfJFqZ29pYWZ%2Bdn2ScWaopJFirq%2BwjKOYpp2jYrewvsOapWaqn66urXnBmpmyZZ6WuqZ51aKcsGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./susanna-thompson-net-worth-83158.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Susanna Thompson Net Worth">&larr;
