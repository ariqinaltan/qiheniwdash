Don’t test your fate (or face) with at-home experiments. But, that’s not to say that chemical <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g32337977/best-face-exfoliators/>face exfoliators</a> won’t give you the same glow-boosting, skin-evening benefits via a safer medium. The best at-home chemical peels are much gentler, won’t require downtime, and will typically be delivered through peel pads, serum-like liquids, or wash-off formulas. Granted, it may take a bit longer to notice a smoother texture or faded <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a25791/how-to-get-ride-of-dark-spots/>dark spots</a>, but incorporating one into your routine is 100 percent worth it in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>At-home chemical peels vary in strength and ingredients, but most aim to deeply exfoliate the skin to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22179792/how-to-get-rid-of-fine-lines/>get rid of fine lines</a> and wrinkles, improve brightness, and lift away unwanted discoloration and brown spots.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead, experts and Marie Claire beauty editors share exactly what to look for in a safe at-home chemical peel, and share the best versions they've tested.&nbsp;(If you’re interested in more professional-grade at-home treatments, check out Marie Claire's favorite <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g32894063/led-light-therapy-masks/>LED masks</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/news/a29189/keratin-treatment/>keratin treatments</a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a35712226/dermaplaning-at-home/>dermaplaning tools</a>.)</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-a-chemical-peel><span>What to Look for in a Chemical Peel</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Type of Acid</strong></li></ul><p>When choosing a DIY peel, your skin type should be your first consideration. "Look at the acids in the peel, and make sure they target the issue you are trying to remedy," Dr. Engelman says. For example, someone with acne-prone skin might want to seek out a salicylic acid peel, while someone with sensitive skin looking to target hyperpigmentation is better suited with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/glycolic-acid-benefits/>glycolic acid.</a></p><ul><li><strong>Strength of Acid&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel recommends that companies use glycolic and lactic alpha-hydroxy acids in concentrations of 10 percent or less, in solutions with a pH of 3.5 or greater, when formulating consumer products. As for salicylic acid? Two percent is the maximum concentration in over-the-counter products.</p><p>You're going to notice that the best at-home chemical peels on this list range from peel pads to overnight treatments. While the version you choose is in large part personal preference, it's worth noting that short-term, wash-off products will typically have less of an impact than leave-on formulas that can work overnight. However, the latter is necessarily better. Wash-off products are generally ideal for more sensitive or dry skin types.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-is-an-at-home-chemical-peel-safe><span>Is an At-Home Chemical Peel Safe?</span></h2><p>First, a reminder: Using a professional-grade product at home is unsafe. Those high intensity acids should only be used by doctors.</p><p>“Due to a wave of how-to YouTube videos and consumer accessibility and professional products available through vendors like Amazon, I am seeing more and more instances of serious damage done to skin—all in a patient's own bathroom," says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dennisgrossmd.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Dennis Gross</a>, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare. "Higher concentrations of acid must be administered by a licensed professional; they can damage skin if they're not neutralized properly." That said, <strong>using a peel pad, mask, or serum specifically designed for at-home use is a-OK</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-at-home-chemical-peels><span>The Best At-Home Chemical Peels</span></h2><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tr2EPcJMtvxVuGaJwDz4NH-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best At-Home Chemical Peel Overall</span></p><p>Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel</p><p>Chances are, you've seen Dr. Dennis Gross' peel pad before. It's everywhere, because it's really, truly the best of the best. It's packed with five different acids—a combination of AHAs and BHAs—to target concerns ranging from acne to dark spots and dry patches. For the two-minute long application process alone, it's well worth the investment.&nbsp;That said, these pads are the real deal, so if you have sensitive or dry skin, don't charge full speed ahead. Start out using them just two times a week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> AHAs and BHAs; Multi-benefit</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Might be too intense for some</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"This product has been amazing in clearing up my face. It's so smooth after each treatment and you can really see all the gook on the pad even after it's been washed. I have seen a significant improvement on my smile lines. They are not as defined and seem to be smoothing out. This is way better than scrubs or harsh cleansing tools. It's the perfect amount of exfoliation. I now use it at least once a week as maintenance after using one sensitive skin treatment." – Sephora&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="LE LIFT PRO RETEXTURIZING AHA PEEL" data-url="https://www.chanel.com/us/skincare/p/133130/le-lift-pro-retexturizing-aha-peel-corrects-exfoliates-resurfaces/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiArLyuBhA7EiwA-qo80BmoqZ1qDP-0avT8LQlbxIp-xAiREbFYe6wskw0foPyzGeGBN1G0ZBoC0poQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiArLyuBhA7EiwA-qo80BmoqZ1qDP-0avT8LQlbxIp-xAiREbFYe6wskw0foPyzGeGBN1G0ZBoC0poQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chanel.com%2Fus%2Fskincare%2Fp%2F133130%2Fle-lift-pro-retexturizing-aha-peel-corrects-exfoliates-resurfaces%2F%3Fgad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiArLyuBhA7EiwA-qo80BmoqZ1qDP-0avT8LQlbxIp-xAiREbFYe6wskw0foPyzGeGBN1G0ZBoC0poQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=chanel.com data-merchant-id=204044 data-merchant-url=chanel.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Axwkt5mRgH5xWZsmu2kRkk-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Luxury Chemical Peel</span></p></a><p>LE LIFT PRO RETEXTURIZING AHA PEEL</p><p>Inspired by Chanel's professional treatments, this at-home chemical peel is designed to be incredibly rejuvenating.

You pour the liquid solution, which is loaded up with glycolic acid, on top of the jar of pads. Let the cotton rounds soak up the liquid for at least a few hours and then you have a whole jar of ready-to-use peel pads.

Shake it up to blend the two liquids: a heavy-duty combo of glycolic, lactic, and malic acids that loosen the bonds of dead cells to clarify skin, and a soothing elixir of antioxidant holy basil and omega-rich jojoba seed oil to calm the acid's effects. Then, act fast and pour a little onto a cotton pad before swiping it across your face. You'll notice an immediate glow and long term brightening benefits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Soothing; Gets rid of dead skin cells</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> A bit oily</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong> "I use it every night and two weeks after, my skin becomes so soft and brighter, and my nose does not have blackheads anymore. But, it is very oily. However, because it gives such a great result, I can bear with it. I apply three drops on the cotton pad (you don't want to use a lot, because it's really oily), I wont apply cream immediately right after.

Together, they plump up fine lines and even out tone. The outcome? An ultra-brightening treatment that gives an airbrushed look to pores.
