The Real Housewives of Atlanta star was hit with a <a href=# rel>second-degree assault charge</a> following an alleged altercation at his Bar One restaurant in Baltimore. According to the purported victim, Chanel Williams, she was with two friends at the location in March 2022. Williams testified the group was enjoying themselves before they were invited by a woman to join the VIP area. Thomas, who co-owns the establishment, reportedly went to hug Williams, and she believed he was a tad intoxicated.</p><p>Things took a turn when Thomas became upset at something. Williams additionally claimed he turned his fury on her, grabbed her by the neck, and squeezed for approximately 30 seconds. That evening, Williams called the police and, the next day, filed a report against Thomas. Williams's friend, Cierra Dunlap, told the court she went to dinner with Thomas and had sex with him once. Dunlap also alleged he sent her $2,500.</p><span><h2>A Verdict Is Reached</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CA - JUNE 29: Cynthia Bailey and Peter Thomas attend Debra L. Lee's 7th annual VIP pre BET dinner event at Milk Studios on June 29, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic)</p><p>We're sure Thomas is somewhere celebrating, as it was reported he was found not guilty of the assault. During the hearing, Thomas claimed he wasn't intoxicated, and Williams was "hysterical." He denied choking Williams, insisting he "eased her off" of him, causing her to fall back into a chair. Despite his version of events, Tammy Rivera has spoken up because Williams is reportedly her niece.</p><p>In a video, Rivera claimed she received several DMs from people asking about Williams. She said she's kept silent out of privacy for her niece but "doesn't play when it comes to [her] family." Rivera also added, "The moral of the story is, my niece didn't want me to help her. She didn't want me involved. She didn't want me to help her with the lawyer, the case, anything."</p><span><h2 id=h-peter-thomas-allegedly-tried-to-apologize>Peter Thomas Allegedly Tried To Apologize</h2></span><p>Rivera further stated Williams was given a State's attorney while Thomas hired a high-profile lawyer. "That's what happened. <a href=# rel>He put his hands on her.</a> He choked her. She called me outside the restaurant crying hysterically. My niece is not loud, she's not ghetto, she does not be in no mess. That's not her world. For her to even call me like that and say that someoneâ€”everybody in the club saw it."</p><p>According to the singer, the following day, Thomas called around trying his best to apologize for the allegedly incident. "You did it. Apologize and move on."
