More interesting facts including the net worth of the musician are waiting for you.</p><h2>Quick facts</h2><ul><li>Name: Jeffrey Atkins (stage name Ja Rule)</li><li>Date of birth: February 29, 1976</li><li>Age: 43 years</li><li>Height and weight: 173 cm, 72 kg</li><li>Family: Born to a family of Jehovah's Witnesses</li><li>Ja Rule kids: Jeffrey Jr., Jordan, Brittany</li><li>Place of birth: Queens, New York, USA</li><li>Zodiac sign: Pisces</li><li>Activity: a rap artist, actor</li><li>Ja Rule net worth: 5 million US dollars</li><li>Marital status: married</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Baby net worth: how has the rapper earned all his riches?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ja Rule was born in the Queens area of New York. He moved from one school to another because of fights. He has begun rhyming from the age of 16 and has signed up with the respected New York rapper Mic Geronimo soon after. Their joint song was produced by Irv Gotti, who later became a partner of the artist in the music business and made a lot of efforts to make Ja Rule net worth so high.</p><h3>Ja Rule bio</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg><p class=align-left>The Roman expression “I came, I saw, I won” ideally suited for the description of the rapid start of Ja's career. He was one hundred percent product of his era, being at the right time in the right place. Severe, but at the same time, the velvety timbre of his voice favourably distinguished the rapper from all the others.</p><p class=align-left>His performance contrasted particularly with the singing of R&B singers and artists, who in large numbers willingly cooperated with him. If Ja chose hardcore rap for himself, then a direct collision and confusion with the same DMX could not be avoided. However, since he played in another field, no one else could merely compete with him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f38986448ec52af.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All the interesting details about Lil Nas X: age, net worth, is he gay?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Josh Peck wife Paige O'Brien bio: age, dad, pregnancy, married life</p><p class=align-left>“Put It On Me” is one of the most famous songs of Ja Rule, as well as, along with “Between Me & You,” the starting point in becoming a rapper as the creator of hits for MTV, radio and all sorts of urban charts.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>Later, as a result, the misalliance of two polar, but talented artists Ja Rule and Ashanti appeared in one of the most striking and long-playing unions in hip-hop. In total, you can count about ten joint songs, including their participation in the tracks of third performers. The essential tracks of Ja and Ashanti were “Always On Time,” “Mesmerize” and, of course, “Wonderful” with R Kelly.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>In 2005, Ja Rule matured to release his first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">collection of major hits</a>. However, besides the already familiar songs on the disc, one could find fresh songs that were not yet published anywhere else. The opening track was “Exodus,” which echoed the same name of the album.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a59327d95d41ab09.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about ASAP Rocky's net worth and career</span></p></a><p></p><p class=align-left>The video, containing the cutting of photos and recordings from concerts and parties, clearly hinted that Ja was full of nostalgia on the days when life hit the key, and the “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Murder Inc</a>.” logo meant 100% quality mark, promising platinum sales and first places in hit parades.</p><p class=align-left>For the next several years, Ja has been busy recording the protracted “The Mirror,” which was supposed to be released in 2007 as an official album. However, the matter was so delayed that already in 2009 the artist simply posted the material to the network for free download.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>Even though by the time “The Mirror” was recorded, the rapper had already rather <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">l</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ost his grip</a> and weight in hip-hop, he was able to give a song as the main single, with the help of which it be can understand how the R&B sounded in 2000 in its best form. “Body” is a track that could be a hit in any year of the beginning of a rapper’s career. In 2007, it was already impossible to make the “flagship” of restarting career for Ja Rule.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8b7dde88d805c248.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything about famous Master P net worth, career, and personal life!</span></p></a><p></p><p class=align-left>In 2011, Ja took up writing a sequel to one of the first albums "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pain Is Love 2</a>". The faithful companion of his first disks Irv Gatti arrived in time to help his old friend.

The rapper had much more pressing problems with the law. Back in 2007, he was caught in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">storage of unregistered weapons</a>. He was given two years of imprisonment, but the serving of punishment began only in the summer of 2011.
